## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a CRM database used to store details on clients for a nonprofit's new web platform. It will allow employees of the nonprofit organization to log in, add clients, edit client information, view details and contact information on client-specific pages along with a map of the office locations. It will also allow employees of the organization to search and filter by certain client-related details.

This project was inspired by the need for a secure CRM to easily store and search for client information at my current position managing a web app for a nonprofit organization.

### Features
Secure User Login: Only users of the nonprofit organization selling licenses for the web app will be allowed to create accounts and log in to view, add, edit, or delete client details and information. All access will be restricted to logged in users who are members of the organization.

Create and edit clients and client details: Users will be able to create clients in the database by entering information such as address, contact information, philanthropic interests, number of employees, contract start & end dates, etc. There will be required fields and optional fields. 

View client details: Users can pull up a detailed page of all client information, including hyperlinks to client contact's email and Google Map of client office locations.

Search and Filter: Users will have the ability to search (or filter) by client name, contact name, office location, philanthropic interestes, campaign interests, etc.

Delete clients: Users can delete, or make client information inactive, upon end of client service.
